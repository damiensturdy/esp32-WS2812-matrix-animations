# esp32-WS2812-matrix-animations

ESP32 platformio project to edit and play animations on "neopixel" WS2811, WS2812 etc pixel displays.
16x16 matrix by default, which pulls from a 128x128 "framebuffer" for a potential 64-frame animation.

Uses fastLED library to drive pixels.

Contains a server-side component, platformio project and rudimentary javascript-based sprite editor.

Currently requires a server with PHP support to store pixels.

ESP32 -> matrix.php <- javascript editor.

No security implemented at this time- you'll want to protect your PHP endpoint.

# Instructions

1) Deploy web assets. Upload the content of "webroot" to your server.
2) Open main.cpp and insert your network details and endpoint 
    (endpoint is the deployed location of "matrix.php")
3) Open graphics.h and configure your LEDs. You might need to set porch to 0.
    (Currently this is configured for my DIY matrix, which has 18 pixels per row with 16 usable)
4) Upload the project to your ESP32, which will stard polling your endpoint and playing animations!

# Editor

The editor is pretty simple. You must name an animation for it to save and play, so type a name in and start drawing!
